# Parametric Functions

#### Description:
These are 3 parametric functions I animated to learn Unity further.

First one is called Ripple and it is basically a sine wave. The twist is that every point's distance to origin is calculated and then integrated into the sine function.

Second one, while it may not be so obvious, is a sphere. You can think of a sphere as a "sum" of circles both vertical and horizontal. The animation is done by animating those vertical and horizontal circles with using your parameters and time as coefficients.

The final one is a Torus. A torus is made up of circles as well! We have 2 radii. The first one determines how "pulled apart" the torus is and the second one determines the thickness of the ring. The animations of the below torus is done by changing those radii.


PS: There is another function which I only animated in 2d called Weierstrass function which is continous everywhere and differentiable nowhere. You can find it in the code! (At least a part of it since it is an infinite series:))
